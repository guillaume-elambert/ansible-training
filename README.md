As an **application engineer** by education, my initial focus was on building and understanding 'my application'.
However, after graduation, the desire to **explore a broader landscape** led me to dive into the **complex world of DevOps**.
This website serves as **the chronicle of my self-learning journey**, where I aim to unravel the complexities of managing information systems infrastructure management.

At this stage, **my primary goal is to gain a comprehensive understanding of DevOps tools**, starting with hands-on experiences to understand their functionality.
This fundamental knowledge is crucial as I aspire to a career in DevOps.

I am currently focusing on two widely-used tools, **Ansible** and **Terraform**. In addition, I have set ambitious goals to self-educate on **Kubernetes**, **Jenkins**, and the **ELK stack**.
Through this documentation, I aim to convey not only my motivation, but also my informed perspective on these technologies.

Join me on this learning adventure, where I navigate through the challenges and triumphs of embracing DevOps, demonstrating my commitment and expertise in the process
