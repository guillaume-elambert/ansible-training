# Ansible training

Before I started learning Ansible on my own, I looked online to see if anyone had given an interesting project for a beginner. I did found a few, but they were either too difficult for a beginner or too simple. That's why I decided to create my own projects. 

The purpose of this site is to retrace my first steps with Ansible so that you can do the same.

I encourage you to follow my thoughts, without copying and pasting what I have done so far, to better understand how Ansible works.

!> Please note that this should not be used as the sole source of training. I am not an Ansible professional, this only reflects my understanding of the technology. During this project, please refer to [the official Ansible documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/) next to my content.
