# Ansible training

Before I started learning Ansible on my own, I looked online to see if anyone had given an interesting project for a beginner. I did found a few, but they were either too difficult for a beginner or too simple. That's why I decided to create my own projects.

The purpose of this repository is to retrace my first steps with Ansible so that you can do the same.
