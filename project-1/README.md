# Project 1 â€“ Ansible-Driven Web Deployment

When I started using Ansible, I decided to create my own project without any documentation other than the official Ansible documentation. \
I think this is a good project for getting to grips with Ansible and understanding its fundamentals. \
I invite you to follow this first training project. 

?> Try to do it yourself and check the answer if you can't get it to work, or check to see if I have done the same thing (**if you haven't, that does not mean you are wrong, because I could be**).
